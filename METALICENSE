The document named LICENSE specifies the license for the TXR program,
including the linenoise library which it uses, found in the
linenoise/ subdirectory. Linenoise uses exactly the same Two-Clause
BSD License, and so the two licenses are combined.

The MPI library, found in the mpi/ subdirectory, was developed over
the yeras 1998-2006 by Michael J. Fromberger. Its license consists
of the mpi/README file, which states:

   This software is in the public domain.  It is entirely free, and you
   may use it and/or redistribute it for whatever purpose you choose;
   however, as free software, it is provided without warranty of any
   kind, not even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for
   a particular purpose.

Whether or not software can be explicitly deposited into the public domain is
controversial, so the MPI library may have to be regarded as being copyrighted
by Michael J. Fromberger. The above text can be reasonably understood to
constitute a license grant which is compatible with TXR's Two-Clause BSD
license in the sense that it is at least as permissive.

TXR is ported to Windows with the help of a derivative of the Cygwin library.
For user convenience, a packaged version of TXR includes the CYGWIN1.DLL, in
accordance with the terms of Cygwin's license, the GNU Lesser Public License,
Version 3.  More details are in the document LICENSE-CYG, which is incorporated
into the Windows installer and displayed to users during installation to inform
them of the dependency on a LGPL-ed library.
