The document named LICENSE specifies the license for the TXR program.

This METALICENSE document provides explanatory notes about the license, and
does not constitute part of that license.

The license is closely based on the two-clause BSD license, and is believed to
be identical to that license in intent. For all practical intents and purposes,
excluding situations of legal proceedings in a court of law or elsewhere, it is
accurate to say that this software is "BSD licensed".

Here is a summary, not guaranteed to be complete and correct, of the
differences between the TXR LICENSE file and the BSD license.

1. The introductory paragraph uses the phrase "of this software" to clarify
   what the license refers to. The BSD license does not (but it does use
   "THIS SOFTWARE" several times in the disclaimer).

2. The introductory paragraph has been modified.  The original introductory
   paragraph states that the redistribution and use are subject to
   the conditions.  The modified paragraph states that only redistribution is
   subject to the conditions, which is obvious from the interpretation of the
   meaning of those conditions.

4. The second, new, introductory paragraph states that use of the program
   constitutes agreement with the disclaimer. The original BSD two-clause
   license neglects to make such an assertion explicitly. However, it is
   obvious that it has this intent.

3. The conditions are unmodified.

4. The disclaimer is substantially abridged from the verbose original.
   Interested parties are hereby encouraged to research the differences.

Regarding the MPI library, the README file in the mpi-1.8.6.tar.gz
archive states:

   This software is in the public domain.  It is entirely free, and you
   may use it and/or redistribute it for whatever purpose you choose;
   however, as free software, it is provided without warranty of any
   kind, not even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for
   a particular purpose.

Whether or not software can be explicitly deposited into the public domain is
legally questionable, so the MPI library must be regarded as being copyrighted
by Michael J. Fromberger. The above text can be reasonably understood to
constitute a license which is compatible with the TXR LICENSE file
in the sense that it is at least as permissive.

TXR is ported to Windows with the help of the Cygwin library.  For user
conveninence, a packaged version of TXR includes the CYGWIN.DLL, in accordance
with the terms of Cywgin's license, the GNU Lesser Public License, Version 3.
